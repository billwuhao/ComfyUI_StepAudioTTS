### Welcome to contribute more voices

The audio file is named as `{Speaker}_prompt_.WAV`, For example, `æ˜Žæ–‡_prompt.WAV`. I will add them to the code. Thus, there is no need for cloning.

The currently supported voices are in the `Step-Audio-speakers` folder. Welcome to PR more voices.


## Supports Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese, Sichuanese, Cantonese etc.
