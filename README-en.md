## Update

[2025-02-25]⚒️: Support custom speaker `custom_stpeaker`. But please note that the three places in the figure must maintain consistent speaker name. When customizing, the `speaker` will automatically become invalid.

![](https://github.com/billwuhao/ComfyUI_StepAudioTTS/blob/master/assets/2025-02-25_20-21-22.png)

In order not to affect the update, i have to move the `Step-Audio-speakers` folder to the `ComfyUI\models\TTS` folder. Please move it yourself. The structure is as follows:

```
ComfyUI\models\TTS
├── Step-Audio-Tokenizer
├── Step-Audio-speakers
├── Step-Audio-TTS-3B
```


## Model Download

Download to the `ComfyUI\models\TTS` folder

### Welcome to contribute more voices

The audio file is named as `{Speaker}_prompt_.WAV`, For example, `明文_prompt.WAV`. I will add them to the code. Thus, there is no need for cloning.

The currently supported voices are in the `Step-Audio-speakers` folder. Welcome to PR more voices.


## Supports Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese, Sichuanese, Cantonese etc.
